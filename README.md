# MetaMarkers: robust marker signatures from single-cell data

To install the package, run the following lines in R:

```
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gillislab/MetaMarkers")
```

You can access a demo of the package (online)[./demo/MetaMarkers.md] or in an interactive (Rmd format)[./vignettes/MetaMarkers.Rmd]. The demo takes approximately 2 minutes to run (not counting installation time). 

The package has been tested on recent R versions (3.6 and 4.0) on Linux and Windows and is expected to work on any decently recent R installation.
