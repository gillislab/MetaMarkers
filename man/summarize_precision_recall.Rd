\title{Compute annotation performance of cell types based on marker sets.}
\usage{
summarize_precision_recall(scores, true_labels, score_threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A marker score matrix as returned by score_cells or compute_marker_enrichment.}

\item{true_labels}{Ground truth labels for the target cells.}

\item{score_threshold}{Numerical vector containing thresholds above which a
cell should be annotated to a cell type.}
}
\value{
A data.frame where each row is a combination of a marker set, a ground
truth cell type and a threshold. Marker scores are used as the predictor,
the ground truth cell type defines a binary class
(do cells belong to the given cell type?), and the threshold decides which
cells are picked as positives or negatives. The performance is summarized
with the following statistics: precision, recall and false positive rate.
